  The difference between zooming time scale, clamped and non clamped zooming and d3 time scale for both daily and intraday data.
  D3's time scale is continuous and linear, finance time plots only points available in the data's date domain without linear (weekend, market holiday) gaps.
  Financetime only plots the available domain, unlike d3, and will not scale or translate to values outside of the domain.
