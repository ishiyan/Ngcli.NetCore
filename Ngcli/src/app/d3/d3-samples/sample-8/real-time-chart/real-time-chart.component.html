    The chart's time domain is moving with the passage of time, which means that any data placed in the chart eventually
    will age out and leave the chart. In addition to the main chart, the component also manages a "focus" window with a
    viewport (d3.brush) that can moved and sized to view an arbitrary portion of the time series data.
